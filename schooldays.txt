Day 1
Today the is the day when the school receives new students. Headmaster Yaga done his speech and
wishes luck to all students, and now the students introducted each other. Lucas, our main character, are
friends already with Shawn and Drew. They are best friends. In this new school they got to meet people
in the class. Jenny, a girl with decent and mild personality, Jason, a good boy who can&#39;t stand injustice,
Taylor, the nerd, Legge who doesn&#39;t appear to speak much, Titto, an ill-tempered boy with obese body,
and Sinan, whom Titto secretly loved since they met in Junior High School. There are also two other
students, called Iczzy and Heater. Even from this first day, you&#39;d be able to tell that they are bullies. They
seem to have a bully gang from their junior high school and will bring that stuff here.
Lucas also have an older brother, called Leo in the higher grades. Lucas do know some of Leo&#39;s
classmates, although he have met them very rarely. As far as he remembers, there are Eason, who was
thought to be Legge&#39;s brother. Lucas saw him once before. Leo also have told him that there are a strong
bully in his class, called Raye.

Day 3
As boring as it can be, the lessons have started already today. Gordon started to teach in Lucas&#39; class. As
usual, Lucas tries to study so that at least he can proceed. Taylor studies really seriously, Shawn did
pretty well while Drew won&#39;t study as much. Iczzy and Heater make troubles in the class, but so far
nothing very serious. Legge seems to be studying quite seriously although he didn&#39;t speak much, nor
asks something to the teacher. Titto turns out to be as lazy as he looks, while Sinan studies averagely like
Jason does.
Lucas, Drew and Shawn sits in the middle-front of the class together, Iczzy and Heater at the back of
them, Legge at the back on the left side while Taylor sits in the front. Jenny sits near Lucas and his
friends, while Titto and Sinan (was so very unfortunate for Sinan to sit next to Titto) sits in the corner of
the class.

Day 9
It&#39;s just another day of a boring school. The students are now used to their new school. And an exam is
coming tomorrow already. The exam doesn&#39;t seem to be an easy one, despite it being the first exam.
That&#39;s why today Lucas goes home just after school. On his way to exit the school, at one point he sees
Iczzy and a bunch of his bullies. They turn out to be the Phoenix bully gang, with Iczzy, Heater and Raye
as the leaders, known as The Big Three. Taylor was there, too. It appears that Iczzy is bullying Taylor, and
threatens him to provide a copy for the coming exam. Seeing this, Lucas dashes in, and attempts to stop
them. Outnumbered, Lucas loses severely, leaving wounds. He alone can&#39;t defeat them all. He didn&#39;t
even saw Iczzy&#39;s moves, he defeated by only his bullies.

Day 10
It&#39;s another day of school, except that there will be an exam just after the lunch breaktime. At the
breaktime Lucas told his best friends, Shawn and Drew about what happened yesterday. Shawn actually
have also seen Heater messing around with some kids yesterday, not to mention that they always cause
problems in the class, too. Drew also said that Raye is doing the same kind of thing on his class. Seems as
if everyone hates them, except themselves and their bully minions. However, they&#39;re so powerful that
nobody can mess around them. Jason, though, appears to have made some attempts in stopping them,
although he can&#39;t do anything serious for now.
Breaktime&#39;s over, exam begins. Lucas didn&#39;t study as much due to his wounds, but he still did his best.
During the exam, Lucas saw Iczzy and Heater cheating the exam with some kind of cheat sheet, most
likely with Taylor&#39;s help judging by what happened yesterday. It was since today that Lucas, Drew and
Shawn was really against the big three bullies of the school.

Day 11
In a world where humans can&#39;t die easily and have unique powers, that&#39;s where this school exists. That is
the reason why there&#39;s not too much harm in fighting, and as you knew Lucas still can study even after
got beat up by Iczzy.
When The Phoenix bullies were told to stop their doing, they said they will stop their work only if The
Big Three (Iczzy, Heater and Raye) and their own bullies were defeated. Lucas didn&#39;t even see Iczzy&#39;s
power earlier because only his bullies do all the work.
Since telling a teacher won&#39;t work, at the lunch break when Lucas, Drew and Shawn talked about the
Phoenix bullies they decided to train their fighting. Lucas trained swordfight (yes, &#39;can&#39;t die easily&#39; above
means even with usually dangerous weapon, like sword and knives they are not really too dangerous,
and isn&#39;t even prohibited at school, and sometimes they even got used in the Physic Education, and is
not much more dangerous than sticks or even bare hands), Drew trained boxing and Shawn trained
archery.

Day 17
After a whole week of hard training, they began to reveal their own unique powers. Lucas started to
train his very first &#39;special move&#39;, called Uppercut, where he swings his sword why launching himself to
the sky. Apparently this move was taught and remastered from his older brother, Leo&#39;s signature special
move, the Primal Uppercut. Previously it was simply called Uppercut but because Lucas learnt a simpler
one and called it Uppercut he named it as Primal Uppercut as the original form of the special move.
Meanwhile, Drew got enormous power of boxing from his intense training. He also begin to train his first
special move, called Mach Punch, where he store power in his fist for a moment, then punch with the
speed of sound, that&#39;s why it&#39;s called Mach Punch. Although, because it&#39;s not perfected yet, it&#39;s not
actually that fast. Meanwhile, Shawn also started training his first special move with the arrows, called
Phoenix Shot. Actually he named it Anti-Phoenix Shot but because it was too long he call it Phoenix Shot.
This special move allows him to shoot an arrow with a red-colored power in it. This arrow will pierce
through anything if perfected. However, like Lucas and Drew, his special move wasn&#39;t perfected, either.
It takes much more training for it. At lunch break time they practiced to fight each other to get to know
the other&#39;s power and result of training. Now that they have enough confidence, they returned and said
that they will challenge Iczzy first.
Anyway, today is where they vote who will be the head of the class and all those stuff. After all those
voting, turns out that somehow Lucas became the head of the class. Seems that Iczzy and Heater&#39;s
bullies knew that Lucas won&#39;t do the job well and therefore they voted Lucas. Sinan as class secretary,
Taylor as treasurer and Jason as security.
